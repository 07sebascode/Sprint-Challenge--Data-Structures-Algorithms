Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Excercise I.
a) O(n)

b) O(log(n)) because on each iteration the size of the problem gets reduced by 1/2

c) O(log(n)) because on each iteration the size of the problem gets reduced by 1/2 on the outer loop, and the other loops only run for 8 times each

d) O(nlog(n)) as the outer loop increases*2 and the inner loop is O(n)

e) O(n^3)

f) O(n)

g) O(n)

Excercise II:

a)
